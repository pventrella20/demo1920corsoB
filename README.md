Edsger W. Dijkstra was born in 1930 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 
Graduating from high school in 1948 and intending to become a theoretical physicist, Dijkstra thought the ability to use an electronic computer might be advantageous. 
At the Mathematical Centre a major project was building the ARMAC computer. 
Developed in 20 minutes while Dijkstra was relaxing on a café terrace with his fiancée, Maria (Ria) C. Debets, his Shortest Path algorithm is still used in such applications as packet-switching software for computer communications.
Returning to The Netherlands in February 2002, Dijkstra died in Nuenen on 6 August 2002.
